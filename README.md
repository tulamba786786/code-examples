# 326 Code Examples

These code examples are based off the current version (Fall 2019) of
the course. The content mostly correspond to the chapters in the book
that is used, however, some of the later examples elaborate or expand
on what is in the book.

* 08 Advanced JavaScript
* 09 jQuery
* 13 (chapter 11) Node.js | 11.1 - 11.4
* 14 (chapter 11) Node.js | 11.5 - 11.6
* 15 (chapter 11) Node.js | 11.7 - 11.8
* 16 (chapter 11) Node.js | 11.9 - 11.12

There is still work to be done to put together a complete set of
examples. Additions are welcomed.
